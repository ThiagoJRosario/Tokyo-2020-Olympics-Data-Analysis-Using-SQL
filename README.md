# Tokyo-2020-Olympics-Data-Analysis-Using-SQL

This mini-project focuses on using SQL to analyze data from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, which was held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset contains a summary of Olympic events, athletes, and their achievements. In this project, SQL is used to load and query the data to answer specific business questions related to athletes, coaches, and medal performance.

The project involves the following steps:

Data Importation: Load the provided CSV files into SQL tables for analysis.
Data Querying: Answer the following business questions using SQL:
Who are the coaches and athletes in the Handball teams?
Who are the coaches of the Australian athletes who won gold medals?
Which countries had female athletes winning gold medals?
Which athletes from Norway won gold or silver medals?
Which Brazilian athletes did not receive any medals?
This project provides a thorough exploration of SQL querying techniques using a real-world dataset, helping to extract meaningful insights related to the performance of athletes and teams in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

Note: The dataset author mentions that the data was extracted from the official Tokyo Olympics website, but the accuracy and veracity have not been validated. The purpose here is to practice SQL skills, not to produce official conclusions.

Data Source: Tokyo 2020 Olympics Dataset from Kaggle.
